# Function cacher 
Implement a Cacher class that helps you cache the return value of a function.
The next function call with the same arguments should return the value from the cache without additional calculations.

E.g.
```
factorial = cacher.withCache(factorial);
const a = factorial(someBigNumber); // => very long calculations...
const b = factorial(someBigNumber); // => the result is returned from the cache - very quickly,
```
## Requirements 

 * Ability to create multiple cache instances using ```new Cacher()```  
 * For the demo - create a html page with the input and the "Calc" button which runs calculations. The result of the function call should appear on the page after the button click.

Use the [math.js](https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs) lib to work with the large numbers. Also, you can use Factorial function from this lib
