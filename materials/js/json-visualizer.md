Create an HTML page split in two parts. The left side is a text area for entering JSON data + "Build tree data" button.<br/>
The right side is the area for displaying the resulting JSON tree.
The [example](https://jsoneditoronline.org/)
## Requirements
  * Input text validation. The error message should be displayed if the text isn't valid JSON 
  * Objects and arrays should be interactive - they can be collapsed / expanded (as in example)
  * Field type indication (e.g. numbers are red, strings are blue ...)
